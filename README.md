# Anomalous diffusion
In a diffusion process, the observables have stochastic motions which their variance change as follows: 
$$\langle X^2(t) \rangle \sim 2Dt^{2H}.$$ 
In a normal diffusion $H=1/2$, the process is called anomalous when $H$ deviates from $1/2$ [[1]](#1). In the latter case there is a violation from the central limit theorem which could have either of these three reasons; 1) the increments $x(t)=y(t+\Delta)-y(t)$ are not independent for all time differences $\Delta$ (the Joseph effect) [[2,3]](#1). 2) the variance of the increments is infinite (the Noah effect). 3) the increment distribution is non-stationary (the Moses effect).
